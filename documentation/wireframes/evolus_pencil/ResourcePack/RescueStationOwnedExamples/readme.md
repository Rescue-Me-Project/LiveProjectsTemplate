# RescueStation Owned Files. For example only.

These files are intended to give you some inspiration!   
They depict several user stories at once, and so must be broken down. Essentially they depict several green message interactions.  
The base way to use them is to place them in 2 browsers, side by side, as they represent the interaction between a rescuee and a rescuer.  
To simulate the rescuer (green) getting an incoming message from the rescuee (orange), tap the rescuestation badge at the top left of the screen.
