**A note on user stories:**

Alice, as a teacher will be needing to do certain things with the app.
Bob as a student will be needing to do different things.
By setting a goal for the character to get to and working out how the app will make it easy for them to accomplish this, we can write a user story.
A user story is the first stage of imagining the use of the app; it describes how the character uses the app to get to their goal.

**Alice creates a new template:**
Alice opens the app at the 'home' screen.
She sees a hamburger menu and taps on it. 
She selects the item 'templates'.
The home page is replaced by a new page.
The new page informs Alice that she doesn't have any templates, and that she can create one. It shows her a button to press to do this.
Alice presses the button. 
The first page of a wizard appears. It prompts Alice to enter a name for the template.
The next page prompts Alice for the maxmimum and minimum of all attributes in the template.
The next page informs that this template has no attributes, and that she should add some. It shows her a button to press to do this.
Alice presses the button.
A new page is shown. It prompts alice to enter a name and a description for the attribute. Alice finds she can only enter a limited number of characters for the name, but she can enter as many as she needs for the description.
When she is finshed, she can press another button.
The page is dismissed. 
Alice can now see the previous page, which has her new attribute listed.
Alice presses the button to add another attribute. 
Once the list has all the attributes she needs, Alice presses a button to accept them.
The template is complete. Alice is returned to the templates page, which lists her new template by its name.

Wireframe shots can illustrate the user story.
Wireframe prototypes with notes can fully describe behaviour, and are the first step to describing app features.
